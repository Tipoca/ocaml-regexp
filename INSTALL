REQUIREMENTS
------------

  Objective CAML >= 2.04

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE 
----------------------

  Simply type the commands

    ./configure
    make
 
  and then become root if necessary, and type

    make install

  This will install the following files:

    In OCaml libdir:
 
       regexp.cmi regexp.cma regexp.cmxa regexp.a

    (required files for the regexp library)

    In OCaml bindir: 

       ocamlregexp

    an OCaml toplevel including the regexp library 

ADVANCED FEATURES
-----------------

  This library is not completely thread-safe, because of hash-consing
  of regular expressions. You may compile a modified version that is
  supposed to be thread-safe (please tell me if you find a bug !) by

  ./configure -enable-thread
  make

  The built libraries are then named regexp-thread.cma and
  regexp-thread.cmxa
